The logical vulnerability in run.py is the use of eval. 
eval function parses the expression passed to it and runs python expression (code) within the program.
Since we have full control of the input to run.py, we don't actually have to generate a file that contains a dicitionary.
We can generate a file that contains the string os.sytem('echo hacked') and when eval would take place it will echo hacked.
Conviently os was already imported in run.py, but if not we could still put a string in the file like so:
'__import__("os").system("echo hacked")'
