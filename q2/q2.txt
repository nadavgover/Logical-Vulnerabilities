The logical vulnerability this time is an unsafe use of pickle.load.
Since we have full control of the input we can use pickle.dumps to whatever we want.
The pickle module allows us to define how the data will be pickled using __reduce__ function.
It returns a tuple of callable and arguments.
I used the callable as os.system and the arguments as echo hacked.
All this I put inside a class and pickled the class.
When run.py unpickled it it printed hacked, and we're done.
